# Agent-based models
Some simple agent-based models created with NetLogo 6.4.

- **PonziScheme** :
This model simulates a Ponzi scheme, a type of investment fraud. Investorsâ€™ money is not truly invested in the market, but instead earlier investors are paid with money from later investors [1]. This model shows how the sustainability of the fund is illusory once too many investors desire to cashout or no new investors are available.

-  **Measles** :
This model simulates the transmission of measles in a human population, taking into account vaccination coverage.
